## File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/           # shadcn/ui components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ EventCreator.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WalletConnect.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.ts      # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ globals.css   # Global styles with Tailwind
â””â”€â”€ App.tsx           # Updated to use EventCreator
```

## Usage

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Connect your wallet** using the button in the header

3. **Create an event** by following the 5-step wizard:
   - Basics: Event details, timing, location
   - Tickets: Supply, pricing, limits
   - On-chain: Treasury, issuer addresses, ASA config
   - Check-in & VC: QR codes, verifiable credentials
   - Review & Deploy: Final review and deployment

## Next Steps

The UI is now ready for you to integrate your smart contract functionality. The form data is structured and ready to be passed to your Algorand smart contracts for:

- ASA creation for tickets
- Smart contract deployment
- Payment processing
- Check-in functionality
- Verifiable credential issuance

## Design Philosophy

The UI follows a **pearlescent glass morphism** design with:
- Subtle gradients and transparency
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible color contrast
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clean, modern typography

This creates a premium feel while maintaining excellent usability and accessibility.
